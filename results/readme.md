The results from the combined face recognition and pose detection are too large for a GitHub repository. Download them from this GDrive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10iEYrEz1A12mmvXL02wn2Si-PTRP8h5-/view?usp=sharing), extract the folder and put it in this directory. The correct folder structure is `results/combined_fr_pd`.
